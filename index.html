                  My name is Homero Montoya I'm 33 years old, this december I'll be married to my beautiful wife for 10 years! We have 2 boys, Guillermo and Gerardo ages 8 and 3.
                  I moved to the US from Michoacan Mexico when I was 8 years old I've lived in and around Albuquerque New Mexico up until several months ago when I moved to KCMO!
                  I work for a local cleaning company in KC but before the pandemic I worked in and operated my own small business in NM. As with everyone else, being shut in was a very difficult time for myself and my family. 
                  This was part of the reason to move to KC start Launch Code and hopefully a new beginning!
